[Contents:]              What is it?
    * What is it?        It is another streaming application to be used over 24+ kbit/s networks,
      Copying            like LAN's and ISDN. At the moment there are a linux / x86 ELF binary
      Software           version and a source version available, under the GNU General Public
      Download           Licence. 
      How_to_start_it?   There's also a win32 version under development for Win95 and WinNT. 
      Mailinglist        NetStreamer offers the possibility to distribute live Audio over network,
      Stations           like Music from internal CD-ROMs or a radio signal on the line-input of a
      Win32_Client       PC. 
      Credits             Well, it may be clear that you need a soundcard, preferably 16 bit. The
      History             NetStreamer sound-quality is 16 bit mono at 8 kHz or 16 kHz. Every sample is
                          ADPCM compressed to 3 bits, so the bandwidth is 24 kbit/s or 48 kbit/s. 
                          NetStreamer consists of a program to "receive" audio, and a program to
                          "transmit" audio. Both programs connect to a NetStreamer Server, a kind of
                          reflector that takes care of the distribution of audio. Every transmitter
                          contacts a Server at startup and claims a certain frequency somewhere
                          between 88.0 and 108.0 MHz, and receivers can tune in on one of these
                          transmitter frequencies.
                          Latest release: NetStreamer 0.17
