This document describes how NetStreamer can be built.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In contrast to previous NetStreamer releases the README file from 
NetStreamer 0.16 no longer contains the "user-documentation", this information 
can now be found in the accompanying html documents.

C++-compiler
============

From NetStreamer 0.16 you'll probably need egcs to compile the sources. This is
because I'll start to use exceptions (one of the C++ benefits) and gcc 2.7
doesn't officially support exception handling.

Anyhow I use egcs 1.0.2. So you should probably do the same.
